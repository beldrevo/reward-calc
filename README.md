### Some notes:

- Project uses hardcoded data set **transactionList** which normally would come as an API response. 
- In real project I would use:
  - React Router for navigating between views (e.g. totalReward view, customerTransactions/Reward view). 
  - Separate APIs to get list of all transactions, search API, get info by Customer, etc.
  - Store to keep list of all transactions or other API responses if needed.
