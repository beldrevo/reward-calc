#### Some notes:

-Project uses hardcoded data set **transactionList** which normally would come as API response. 
-In real project I would use:
- React Router for navigating between views (e.g. totalReward view, customerTransactions/Reward view). 
- Separate APIs to get list of all transactions, search API, get info by Customer, etc.
- Store list of all transactions in global store.
